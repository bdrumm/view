Bring your life into focus with this data-driven home dashboard. You must first start a Firebase and a Google Apps NODEJS project. The keys from these projects can be included in the ".env" file. Just rename ".env-example" to ".env". GOOGLE is for Google Apps; FBS is for Firebase Service Account; and FBC is for Firebase Config.

```
$ npm install
$ gulp build OR gulp dev
$ npm start
